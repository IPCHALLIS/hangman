# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 2
In milestone_2.py I imported the random module with the choice method. This was used to randomly select a word from the word_list variable. Following this, I created a new variable called guess and assigned this to a user input function. From here, I implemented if-else statements to check if the user had entered a single alphabetical letter. This printed a different message in the termianl depending on whether the input was valid or invalid.

To start working on this project within VSCode I initially had to clone and copy the HTTPS repository link. I then pasted this into the terminal window, preceded by the "git clone" command. I created the milestone_2.py file from the Bash terminal using the "touch" command. Since then, I have been using the "Commit" and "Sync" options that are available in VSCode's 'Source Control' menu as this seems to make communication with GitHub much faster than the terminal commands.
